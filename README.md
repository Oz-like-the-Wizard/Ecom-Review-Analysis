# Ecom-Review-Analysis-Project
 A freelance project to compare and visualize e-com ratings of brands and products to their categories.
 
 
There are three main parts of this project:

1- Calculate the e-com average score of each brand/product based on the "attributes" (topics such as "Delivery", "Recommendation", "Taste", etc.) of the review

2- Create a heatmap to display and compare the attribute scores of a specific brand/product to their category averages:

- Example screenshots from the project can be found in the repository.

- The heatmap needs to have 3 color ranges based on the average score of the category:
 - Red: if the average score is lower than 4 (<4)
 - Yellow: if the average score is between 4 - 4.5
 - Green: if the average score is above 4.5
 
 3- Apply & display the results of Welsh's t-test & effect size to analyze if there is significant difference between the brand/category score and the attribute average
